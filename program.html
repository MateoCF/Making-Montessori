  <ul>
    <li>Day 1</li>
    <li>Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Congratulations, you played yourself.</li>
    <li>Day 2</li>
    <li>You smart, you loyal, you a genius. They don’t want us to win. We the best. Mogul talk. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. Another one. Another one. Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. Cloth talk. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow.</li>
    <li>Day 3</li>
    <li>The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Lion! Eliptical talk. Hammock talk come soon. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough?</li>
